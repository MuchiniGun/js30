# js30
30 Days of JavaScript Mini Projects to improve my Vanilla JS. Resource : https://javascript30.com/

I will try use this as a blog to recap what I learn each day. And P.S. I started on the 15th of November

Day 1 : Good, learnt to use data-keys correctly and calling them from JS
Day 2 : Good, learnt "transform-origin" property in css that I had never used before as well as using JS to refresh constantly
